* original checklist (for reference only)

  - [ ] make sure buildbot, travis, appveyor are green
  - [ ] NEWS.rst: summarize user-visible changes, aim for one page of text
  - [ ] update doc files
    - NEWS.rst: Add final release name and date to top-most item in NEWS.
    - relnotes.txt
    - CREDITS
    - docs/known_issues.rst
  - [ ] change docs/INSTALL.rst to point to just the current
    tahoe-lafs-X.Y.Z.tar.gz source code file
  - [ ] announce the tree is locked on IRC
  - [ ] git pull, should be empty
  - [ ] git tag -s -u 68666A7A -m "release Tahoe-LAFS-X.Y.Z" tahoe-lafs-X.Y.Z
    - produces a "signed tag"
  - [ ] build locally to make sure the release is reporting itself as the
    intended version, make tarballs too (for comparison only)
  - [ ] push tag to trigger buildslaves. Making a code change is no longer
    necessary (TODO: pushing just 1.12.0b2 was insufficient: travis fired,
    but not buildbot)
    - git push official master TAGNAME
    - that will build tarballs
  - [ ] make sure buildbot is green
  - [ ] download tarballs+wheels
  - [ ] announce tree is unlocked
  - [ ] compare tarballs+wheels against local copies (but sign upstreams)
  - [ ] sign each with "gpg -ba -u 68666a7a FILE"
  - [ ] twine upload dist/*
  - [ ] test "pip install tahoe-lafs" (from PyPI)
  - [ ] upload *.asc to org ~source/downloads/
  - [ ] copy the release tarball,sigs to tahoe-lafs.org: ~source/downloads/
  - [ ] move old release out of ~source/downloads (to downloads/old/?)
  - [ ] send out relnotes.txt:
    - add prefix with SHA256 of tarballs, release pubkey, git revhash
    - GPG-sign the email with release key
    - send to tahoe-announce@tahoe-lafs.org and tahoe-dev@tahoe-lafs.org
  - [ ] update Wiki front page: version on download link, News column
  - [ ] update Wiki "Doc": parade of release notes (with rev of NEWS.rst)
