"""
This file contains the cross-account management code. It creates per-client
Account objects for the FURLification dance, as well as the 'anonymous
account for use until the server admin decides to make accounting mandatory.
It also provides usage statistics and reports for the status UI. This will
also implement the backend of the control UI (once we figure out how to
express that: maybe a CLI command, or tahoe.cfg settings, or a web frontend),
for things like enabling/disabling accounts and setting quotas.

The name 'accountant.py' could be better, preferably something that doesn't
share a prefix with 'account.py' so my tab-autocomplete will work nicely.
